2 versions...  Each are the same except the "-ND" version removes the 5 second delay which is intended to allow for serial connection so all data can be captured.<br><br>

# Rev 1.2a - 01NOV2023
Initial public release.<br><br>

# Rev 1.3b - 28NOV2023
Adds folders for each Serial Number backed up.  Each subsequent backup will also go into that same folder for that individual serial number.<br><br>

# Rev 2.0b - Not Released
Adds function to get the passwords of OG Xbox Slim Seagate Drives.<br><br>

# Rev 2.1b - Not Released
Adds Rubber Jacketed drives to password function.<br><br>

# Rev 2.2 - 01/05/2024
First release with HDD Password grabbing without EEPROM or Xbox Console.  No changes to the EEPROM side of things.  Beta tag removed from overall Firmware; however, the Seagate side of things will be considered a beta feature.  There may be bugs... and some HDDs are slow to boot and some have minor errors....  These may cause unknown results.  So error catching is incorporated, but again, unsure for every scenario.  Enjoy!<br>
The versions with still be ND for No Delay, and regular... the Regular (with 5 sec delay) will also include Verbose mode.  This will allow you to see what the HDD is outputing on boot.  This information will only be seen on the serial Terminal and not in the logs.<br><br>

# Rev 2.3 - 01/14/2024
Adds picoPromSDs digital serial number to log<br><br>
