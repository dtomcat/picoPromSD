1.1 is the initial released version.  Those who backed the initial project and funded it have a limited edition 1.0a version (Thank you!).  This will not be released and is solely for the limited backers.  1.1 just has minor trace redesigns and the "Advanced users" port has been removed.  Version 1.5H has already been designed and as soon as it's tested, It will be uploaded.  I do not recommend building rev 1.1 as 1.5H has major changes to the board to allow for lower cost builds.  Functionally, they will be the same.  Enjoy!<br><br>

# Rev 1.1 - 12DEC2024
